NUnit Project Generator
=======================

This is a simple CLI for generating an NUnit project file.

The project generator will look through a given directory for any DLLs that reference `nunit.framework` and contain
classes that use the `[TestFixture]` attribute and generate an NUnit project file (AutogeneratedProject.nunit) that includes those assemblies. The generated project file is then output to the directory that was passed as an argument.

It supports the following command line arguments:

* `directory` (short name `d`) The full path to the root of the directory to search
* `exclude` (short name `e`) An optional argument for a folder to exclude from the search
